            Orginally a character from the dragonmaid anime and known for her crush
            on the famous dragon loli, Saikawa soon became a hit on the internet.
            A running gag involves her becoming overwhelmingly flushed with bliss
            every time she and Kanna make physical contact. Due to Saikawas green
            longsleeve with a yellow rabbit, it came to my mind to combine her with
            Overwatchs favourite Korean mech pilot DVA. I gave Saikawa DVAs Headset
            and colored the rabbit on her longsleeve neonpink and that is how
            <b>SaikaVA</b> was born.

            My goal is it to create little arcade games playable in the browser
            and/or on mobile devices. Therefore I am learning to code next to
            creating SaikaVA memes. In order to avoid copyright problems in the
            future every game sprite needs to be open source or self-made. I would
            like to use simple pixelarts for that and I am looking for pixelartists
            and developers. The project is public on Github and you can contribute
            all you like or join us in our discord.
